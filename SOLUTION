Kernel System Calls
-------------------
1. The program ./whatIdo executed
2. sets the configurations and memory needed
3. checks for the details of ./welcomeToDevopsTheHardWay
4. creates a file 'goodluck' inside this directory and writes inside "There you go... tell me what I do"


Broken Symlink
-------------------
Symbolic links are not updated.
hard links always refer to the source, even if moved or removed
they have to remove the "-s" flag and create a hard link.



Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111 = 7 , 100 = 4 , 10110 = 22
2. 0-255 = 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1
3. The method is the two's complement. In this method you use the binary representation
   of the positive number, flip all the bits and then add 1.
   For example:
   a. 4 = 00000100
   b. after the flip = 11111011
   c. add 1 = 11111100 = -4
 4. a. seperate the number to 2 parts - integer and fractional
    b. divide the integer by 2 as many times as possible. write the remainder.
    c. write the remainders in reverse order - thats the binary for the integer.
    d. Multiply the fraction by 2 as many times as needed ( as the binary bits left )
    e. the result will be the (integer representation.fraction representation)
